# Iris-Image-Processing-Lib

I designed and developed this library in C# with Visual Studio 2008 for detecting and isolating the pupil area as a step for finding the iris area. The following screen shot shows how the program is used to load an iris image sample

The second step is to detect and isolate the pupil area as shown in the following screen shot where the program automatically open multiple windows and automatically align them to show the steps:

The last step is to detect and isolate the iris area. Again the program automatically open multiple windows and show the steps:

Please note that this work is part of an unfinished research on Iris detection that I started years ago with Dr. Loay the head of computer sceience at Baghdad university, I stopped progressing on the research because I started my Ph.D. program and didn't have the time to finish it. The steps and details of every step is documented in the prgram and the library, please feel free to download and use both of them.
